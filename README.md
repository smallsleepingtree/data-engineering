# Welcome, WhatsTheDealWithDeals Employee!

We're excited for you to join the LivingSocial family!  We know this transition has been rough on you, literally - we're looking into using a less coarse fabric for the company uniform, but you know, the economy.

## Very Elaborate Instructions

1. Navigate your browsing machine to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
1. If you are:
  * a Senior Executive Level Tab-Delimited Data Upload Administrator, your DevOps representative should have already provided you with an email address and password for signing in.  Type these into the relevant pretty rectangular boxes and click the shiny button, then follow the instructions.
  * **not** special, choose the option to Create a New Account, and follow the instructions given.  After creating your account, you will need to be approved by the administrator before you can upload files.  Go poke them  repeatedly with a mechanical pencil until they comply.
1. Keep following the instructions onscreen.
1. Even more following of instructions.
1. Remember to breathe.
1. Have fun.
1. Are you done?  If so, go home and take a bath, or watch something educational on the telly!  Congratulations.
