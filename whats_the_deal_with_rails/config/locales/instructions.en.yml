          <h3>Who are you?</h3>
          <p>
            We bought fancy computers with frankly ridiculous amounts of flops
            and texels and wads of cache, and still our 11-year old shepherd mix Toby
            (whose eyes have become as cloudy as a Portland winter) is better at
            face recognition.  So it's embarassing to ask, but could you please let
            us know who you are?
          </p>

            have an account, or the <strong>Register for an Account</strong> form

            That's not an imperative.  We're not asking you to put in an order for
            firewood. Though, admittedly, it's gotten a lot less comfortable here
            since our gas was shut off.  We offered the gas company early access to
            several enticing deals (such as our ever popular <strong>$89 for $90
            worth of cash</strong>), but they were surprisingly uninterested.

            Here's a list of files that have already been uploaded - click on the
            ID or filename to view more details.  Or, if you've got some exciting
            order-filled tab-delimited files sitting around, upload them!  Just use
            the button below the list.  The blue one.  Blue as the pilot
            light that now lives only in our wistful dreams.

          <h4>Thank You, from LivingSocialÂ® and Jerry Seinfeld Presents What's the
            Deal With Deals</h4>
          <p>
            What you're doing here is mind-bogglingly important.  Somewhere between
            millions and dozens of dedicated customers braved the admittedly disastrous
            wreck of a site that was What's the Deal With Deals, and the bravest of
            those somehow managed to purchase deals.  Then our loosely organized team
            of bears wrote those orders down on chocolate chip packages, and we sort of
            forgot about them.  We were too busy spinning in circles in our fabulous
            VC-funded Herman Miller chairs.

            Now it's up to you, courageous unpaid volunteer (did we forget to mention
            the "unpaid" part?  We've been swamped here, sorry) to make sure little
            Timmy's dad gets his <strong>$40 for $38 worth of Child-proof Well
            Covers</strong>.

            Well, aren't you special. The 1%, the aristocracy, et cetera. Your power
            is almost palpable - we could feel it as soon as you visited this web page.
            And all of these hopeful potential Tab-Delimited File Uploaders feel it,
            too, as they sit awaiting your decision, drenching their only casual-formal
            attire in the kind of sweat that leaves stains.  Fortunately for them,
            we've got a great <strong>$165 for a 3-month supply of Tide</strong> offer
            in the pipeline.

          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <p>
            Users in the following list have created accounts, but aren't authorized to
            upload files yet. Click the
            <span class="btn btn-mini btn-success">
              <i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i>
            </span>
            button to approve the user, and the
            <span class="btn btn-mini btn-danger">
              <i class="icon-thumbs-down"></i>
            </span>
            button to reject them.  Keep in mind that rejection here, just like in real
            life, is not easily undoable - it would require opening a ticket with DevOps,
            which is a fancy way of saying "giving up."  Rejected users will no longer
            appear in this list, or most likely anywhere in public ever again.

            Here are the orders we found in the tab-delimited file.  These are now in
            a Database&trade;, which is sort of like a farm, except that instead of
            ponies and muddy boots and lemonade, it has transactions and foreign keys
            and triggers.  If any of the following doesn't look right to you, please
            let us know and we'll recommend a good optometrist.
