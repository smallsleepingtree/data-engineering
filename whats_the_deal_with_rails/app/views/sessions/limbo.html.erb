<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>The illustrious joint staffs of WhatsTheDeal and LivingSocial, in their distinctly finite wisdom, are worried about the integrity of WhatsTheDeal's data and want to keep this portal secure.  Never mind the recent audit revealing that 85% of the orders were placed by Jerry Seinfeld himself, reportedly while strung out on dried fava beans.  Apparently if you roast the fava bean extremely slowly (we're talking months here), grind it up, and add about 3 kilos of politician-grade psychoactive drugs, it can really do a number on you.  And that number isn't "yoga."  What are we talking about?</p>
<h3>Okay, but what can I do?</h3>
<p>You'll need to fill out Form 35B in triplicate.  The bottom two copies go in the shredder, just to be safe, and the top copy goes to WhatsTheDeal's HR department, which (due to budget cuts prior to the acquisition) is located in a closet near the west stairwell, and is staffed primarily by a broom and two boxes of latex gloves.</p>
<p>After turning in your form, your best bet would be to go home and spend more time with your family.  Tackle that project you've been procrastinating on.  Try a new breakfast cereal.  There are a lot of good ones made with maple, these days.</p>
<h3>None of this is helping.</h3>
<p>Oh!  You actually want to sit in front of a glowing screen, mindlessly uploading tab-delimited files until your computer actually runs out of tabs with which to delimit?  Okay.  In that case, just hold tight - the administrator will see that your account is pending the next time she logs in, and you'll get an email when she authorizes you.</p>
